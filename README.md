# Stack Overflow in Recursive Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common error in recursive functions: unbounded recursion leading to a stack overflow.  The `foo` function calculates the factorial recursively.  For large inputs, this recursion depth exceeds the system's limits, resulting in a stack overflow error. The solution showcases an iterative approach to avoid this issue.
